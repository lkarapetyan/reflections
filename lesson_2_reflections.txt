What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?
Initializing the git repository allows to start
tacking the files in the folder. It allows to start
versioning the file changes.


How is the staging area different from the working
directory and the repository? What value do you think it
offers?
The working directory is the directory where you actually
work. The staging area is the part where you include the
changes you want to commit. The Repository is the place
when you keep your commits.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one
commit per logical change?
After completing each logical part, add changes to the stage
area and commit that changes only.
